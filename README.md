# Keras OCR Text Extraction Project

## Overview
This Python project leverages the power of Keras OCR to extract text from images. Whether you need to extract text from scanned documents, images, or any other visual content, this project provides a convenient and efficient solution. Keras OCR is a deep learning-based optical character recognition (OCR) library that allows you to recognize and extract text from images.

## Features
- Text extraction from images and scanned documents.
- Easy-to-use Python interface.
- Pre-trained models for various languages.
- High accuracy and robustness.

## Prerequisites
Before using this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)
- pabda
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- Keras OCR

## Pre-trained Models
Keras OCR provides pre-trained models for various languages and text recognition tasks. You can find the pre-trained models in the Keras OCR Models Repository. To use a specific model, you can specify it when initializing the pipeline.

## Usage
for using the file in your own google collab. 
Download Kaggle API Token: Go to your Kaggle account settings on the Kaggle website. Scroll down to the "API" section and click on "Create New API Token." This will download a JSON file called kaggle.json. Keep this file secure as it contains your API credentials.
Upload the file in the collab. then run the codes which is given in the notebook.
